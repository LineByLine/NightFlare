Okay, for the second GDD, lots of things changed, might make it work... or not, we'll see.

---- Title ----
The name of our game will be called Project: Fireshadow. Basically, think of our game taking place in a gothic, somewhat-futuristic setting. Will it be fantasy? Likely so.


---- Background ----
You are one of many members of the Alphagon, a dragon-wolf hybrid tribal race who are brilliant trackers, dangerous hunters, and lethal close-range combatants. 
The Alphagon were once at war with the Human race for territory, but that has since ended and both races became separated from each other for years. However,
despite separation, any contact between Human and Alphagon would end in conflict, as both continued carrying the hatred that remained with them after the war.

Recently, there have been raids and invasions on lone human settlements that lie within the boundaries of the city. These unknown invaders can't be tracked or hunted
by normal Human means. Knowing that there could be an even greater threat than the Alphagons, the Humans decided to establish peaceful relations with them in return for
the extermination of the unknown enemy.

Becoming an emissary of the Alphagon, you are enlisted into Project: Fireshadow and given a new codename: Umbra. Your job is to be deployed in select locations where
plentiful activity has been detected by hostile forces, and eliminate as many as you can.


---- Gameplay ----
Project: Fireshadow will be a 2D Top-Down Shooter, whose core is wave-survival. As Umbra, you will be deployed on a map, where your objective is to fight off wave after wave of
progressively-difficult enemies. As you move up the wave count, more enemies spawn per wave, and the difficulty and challenge lies in not only overwhelming numbers of
enemies, but overwhelming numbers of differing enemy types.

Playing as Umbra, your specialty lies in hand-to-hand combat; you suck with guns. 

During training, you accidentally shot yourself... twice, that's why you suck with firearms. 

You could use bows, crossbows, and throwing knives, but most of the specialized, core gameplay lies in melee combat. The enemies you will be fighting can take on both 
melee and ranged roles, and each role can be specialized in a certain way that makes them harder to defeat.

Using melee is encouraged because to make it more interesting and beneficial to you, you will be able to use special abilities that give you an edge in any fight, doing things
from boosting your damage and health, to allowing you to warp from one enemy to the next, destroying them through every warp.

Overall, Project: Fireshadow is a wave-survival, 2D Top-Down Shooter that encourages melee combat, but maintains the shooter-aspect by giving you the option to use ranged 
weapons, but note they are not as effective as melee. They will, however, be important for the extermination of certain enemies that running hand-to-hand would 
otherwise be fatal.
