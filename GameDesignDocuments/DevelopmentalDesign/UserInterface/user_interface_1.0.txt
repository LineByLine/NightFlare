Game: Project: Nightfyre

Below are specific details of what game controls and settings I want available to the player, as
well as where they're located. Refer to drawings for a clearer picture of their location on the game screen.

=========================================================================================================
Design Legend

- // [category] \\
    Denotes a specific category from this document's primary legend below. Any items below a certain
    category are the mechanics specific to the category in-question.

- -- [mechanic] --
    Denotes a particular mechanic, interface, enemy, behavior, etc. that falls under a certain category.
    These will be what programmers are developing.

- ++ [character] ++
    Denotes a particular character (if any) that the mechanics specifically apply to. This helps organize
    what mechanics apply to whom, as some mechanics, like health, damage, and weapons, 
    can apply to not only the player, but enemies and bosses as well.

- > [specific]
    Denotes a specific fragment of the mechanic. These are small details that comprise the entirety of
    the entire mechanic. Think of them as the little details that give better insight to what the
    mechanic is.

=========================================================================================================
Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- // Interfaces \\
    Includes main game screens that provide the user a form of direction on where to go, or 
    give them a place to stay. These range from the common Main Menu screen to in-game interfaces.

- ++ Aesthetics ++
    Non-functional graphics that serve to provide a form of aesthetic appeal to a certain game screen.

- ++ Controls ++
    Interactable buttons for the player to transition from one interface to the next or adjust certain
    settings.

        > Game Title
            The title of our game will be Project: Nightfyre, and will be located on the top left-side of the
            game screen, centered accordingly.

    ++ Controls ++

        > Start Game
            Opens up the Save Selection interface. Start Game will be located about halfway on the game
            screen and a distance from the left-side of the screen. It will be below the title of the game
            and be the top-most button above the others, centered accordingly.
        
        > Options
            Opens up the Options Panel interface. Options will be located slightly below Start Game and
            centered accordingly.
        
        > Credits

            Options and centered accordingly.
        
        > Quit
            Closes and exits out of the game. Quit will be located slightly below Credits and centered
            accordingly.


-- Options Panel --

If any of the options below are customizable through the Unity.exe start-up, enable these options through that.

    ++ Controls ++

        > Resolution
            Adjusts the resolution of the game. We will be using a 16:9 aspect ratio, and the available
            resolutions should be:
                
                1024 x 576
                1152 x 648
                1280 x 720
                1366 x 768
                1600 x 900
                1920 x 1080
            
            Our game will use a 1280 x 720 resolution as our game display base. More resolutions may become
            available depending on how well our game is progressing. Resolution will be located at the
            top-most place of the game screen.
        
        > Fullscreen
            Sets the game's resolution to fullscreen mode, no matter the resolution. Fullscreen is located
            as a enable-button below on the left-side of Resolution.

        > Music
            Adjusts the sound level for the in-game music. Music will be located below Resolution.
        
        > Sound
            Adjusts the sound level for the in-game... sounds. Sound will be located below Music.
