==== user_mechanics_1.0 ====

I decided to split our game's mechanics into a few categories. Here are a few to start with:
- Survival
- Combat
- Utility
- Resource
- Trade
- User Behavior


=========================================================================================================
Legend:

// [Category] \\ 
    
    specific category for a particular group of mechanics

-- [mechanic] -- 
    
    the actual mechanic; usually the mechanics assigned for programmers to create

++ [active character] 
    
    what the mechanic will effect in a certain, particular way

- [details]
    
    details for how the mechanic works with the active character (if any); usually what
    the programmer focuses on when developing the mechanic; expect specifics below each
    detail section

=========================================================================================================


// Survival \\


-- maximum health
    
    ++ player

        - maximum health set to 100 points
            
            at any given point, the player's health will be set to 100 at the start of a round

        - using a points-based system
            
            health is measured by points, or health points; this will affect how health is deducted

        - health restores back to 100% its maximum at the end of a wave
            
            once a wave ends, the player's health returns to 100% its maximum capacity, no matter what
        
        - Game Over at 0 health
            
            at 0 health, it's Game Over for the player; this is a separate mechanic that will be explained later
    
    ++ enemy

        - maximum health is at least set to x points for the most basic enemy unit
            
            maximum health varies by enemy type, but the minimum health for enemies should be x points
        
        - using a points-based system
            
            explained above for player; same thing for player


-- natural recovery

    ++ player

        - player recovers x health/ second upon taking damage after a 3-second delay
            
            after taking damage, every 3 seconds, the player gradually recovers x health/ second; critical 
            echanic that helps the player survive
        
        - recovery can't exceed 3/4 the maximum health
            
            natural recovery cannot restore the player's health above 3/4 its maximum capacity; e.g.: at 100 health
            maximum, only up to 75 can be restored through natural recovery
        
        - interruptable by damage
           
            at any point during recovery delay does the player take damage, the delay timer resets to
            3 seconds
        
        - only activates when player's health falls below 3/4 its maximum

            if the player's health falls below 3/4 its maximum, natural recovery can activate
    

// Combat \\

=========================================================================================================
Combat Legend:

type - what kind of attack it is; choice among melee, ranged, and magic (yes, it's like RuneScape)
weapon - what weapon makes this attack available; affects the kind of damage inflicted
attack damage - how much damage this attack inflicts
attack speed - how fast this attack can be used
range - the range at which this attack succeeds and hits the target
charge - time required for attack to be charged before activation

=========================================================================================================
