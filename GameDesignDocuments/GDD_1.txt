Oh look, the first game design document for our game; didn't see that coming.


---- Background:

Corrupted, fanatical crusaders have gained control over a fictional kingdom, whose name I haven't even decided yet. You, an unholy and dangerous wraith, are summoned
from a realm of eternal torment and agony by those seeking to overthrow the corrupted crusaders and restore order to the land.

As this wraith, you have a form of free-will. You serve those that summon you, but these summoners are not evil people, rather those desperate and in need of a form of magical
power to aid them in their quest to overthrow an inhumane and fanatical empire.


---- Objective:

The game is a 2D Top-Down Shooter whose core is wave-survival. Players will assume the role of a melee-only unit; they can only fight those
within melee range and nothing else. Enemies, however, can assume melee and ranged roles, and having both intermixed during a wave can be
difficult.

That's why the player, as a core melee unit, has abilities that distinguish them as a special unit from the rest. These abilities range from
self-healing to warping from one enemy to another, and these help the player not only fight off different enemy units, but give them a chance
to reach higher waves. Having abilities also makes it so each wave isn't dragging along; players can deliberately use them early to finish
off early waves fast, then move on.


---- Mechanics:

NOTE: Mechanics are listed as a general category, then sub-categories of those general mechanics. Every single item under a general category
counts as a mechanic; this does NOT mean every sub-item is a mechanic I want to see in our game.

Also, the mechanics listed below are borderline-basic; over time they could become complex as our game becomes more developed.

> Health <
    - permanent and regenerative
    - health bar vs. 3-life vs. 1-life
    - restoring health is possible
    - overhealing is possible
    - lives system

> Armor <
    - temporary "health"
    - armor count vs. armor bar
    - gaining armor as a permanent layer of "health" is possible
    - takes damage first, then health

> Shield <
    - permanent and regenerative
    - way smaller than health
    - takes damage first, then armor, then health

> Damage <
    - player damage
    - enemy damage
    - damage immunity
        * elemental damage
        * scripted, task-oriented damage

> Items <
    - restorative items
    - temporary buffs
    - special weapon drops
    - armor items

    - Left-mouse button to Attack
    - Hold left-mouse button, then release to Charge Attack
