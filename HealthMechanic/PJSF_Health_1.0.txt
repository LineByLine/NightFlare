    ==== maximum health ====
        
        -- player maximum health --
            
            >>> player maximum health is 100 points
                Having 100 maximum for health is usually a norm. Anything higher than this can make playing our game too easy; we want it be challenging.
                The player will have access to items, abilites, and other mechanics that benefit their survival.

            >>> static; does not change by any means
                The player's health can't be increased by any means. Items and abilities can't permanently increase the player's maximum health, but
                it can provide overheal should the player's health be at 100; explained below.

            >>> restores to max at the end of every wave <
                Once a wave ends, the player's health automatically restores to its maximum. This allows the player to be rewarded for surviving
                with the gift of health, and encourages them to continue on to the next round.
        
        -- enemy maximum health --
            
            >>> enemy maximum health is at least x points; varies by enemy type <
                The maximum health for the most basic unit type should be x. However, at the end of the day, the maximum health for enemies 
                varies by enemy type.

            >>> dynamic; maximum health increases by x points every wave <
                Every wave that the player survives, all enemy types become more durable by having their maximum health increased by x points
                per wave survived.
            
            >>> resets to max for every new enemy spawned
                Every freshly-spawned enemy unit should have their health at its maximum. At no point should their health be any lower than its
                maximum.


    ==== auto-recovery ====

        -- player auto-recovery --

            >>> player recovers x health/ second after 3 seconds of not taking damage <
                Should the player not take damage for 3 seconds, their health will slowly regenerate x health/ second, for a maximum
                of x health/ 5 seconds. Having auto-recovery is crucial to our game because it allows our player to strategize when
                to attack and run on waves with overwhelming, potentially high-damaging enemies.

            >>> auto-recovery interrupted upon taking damage
                Upon taking damage, player auto-recovery resets back to its 3-second timer. This applies even if auto-recovery is 1
                second away from activating; no matter where the timer for auto-recovery is at, any damage taken during the cooldown
                will reset it.

            >>> can't activate if player's health is above 3/4 its maximum
                Should the player's health be above 3/4 its maximum at any given time, auto-recovery will never activate. This happens
                even if the player's health is at 76/100; auto-recovery will remain locked until the player's current health drops below
                75.

            >>> recovered health can't exceed 3/4 the maximum health
                Auto-recovery can't restore health above 3/4 the maximum health. It's valuable enough that health can be recovered, and
                setting a limitation to health recovery adds extra challenge for the player to avoid taking damage at all costs.
