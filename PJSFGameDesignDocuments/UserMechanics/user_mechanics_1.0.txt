// [Category] \\ 
    specific category for a particular group of mechanics

-- [mechanic] -- 
    the actual mechanic; usually the mechanics assigned for programmers to create

++ [active character] 
    who the mechanics affect

- [details]
    details for how the mechanic works with the active character (if any); usually what
    the programmer focuses on when developing the mechanic; expect specifics below each
    detail section

=========================================================================================================


// Survival \\

-- maximum health
    
    ++ player

        - maximum health set to 100 points
            the player's health will be set to 100 points

        - using a points-based system
            health is measured by points, or health points; this will affect how health is deducted
    
    ++ enemy

        - maximum health is at least set to x points for the most basic enemy unit
            maximum health varies by enemy type, but the minimum health for enemies should be x points
        
        - using a points-based system
            explained above for player; same thing for player

-- natural recovery

    ++ player

        - player recovers x health/ second after a 3-second delay followig damage taken
            after taking damage, every 3 seconds, the player gradually recovers x health/ second; critical 
            echanic that helps the player survive
        
        - recovery can't exceed 3/4 the maximum health
            can't restore the player's health above 3/4 its maximum capacity; e.g.: at 100 health
            maximum, only up to 75 can be restored through natural recovery
        
        - can be interrupted by damage
           at any point during recovery delay does the player take damage, the delay timer resets to
            3 seconds
        
        - only activates when player's health falls below 3/4 its maximum
            if the player's health falls below 3/4 its maximum, natural recovery can activate
    

// Combat \\

=========================================================================================================
Combat Legend:

++ all

    - type

        - block
            Stand your ground and defend yourself from attacks, reducing incoming

// User Behavior \\

    ++ player

        - [W, A, S, D]
            move

        - [Left-Mouse Button]
            attack
        
        - [Left-Mouse Button (Hold)]
            charge attack
        
        - [Right-Mouse Button (Hold)]
            block
        
        - [P or Esc]
            pause game
        
        - [Spacebar]
            interact
        
        - [E]
            pick up


// Enemy AI \\

    ++ enemy

        - movement: walking
            Enemy unit "walks" (moves slowly) at a speed of s; varies by enemy type
        
        - movement: running
            Enemy unit "runs" (moves fast) at a speed of s; varies by enemy type
        
        - attack: melee attack
            For melee enemy units, initiate a melee attack when the player is within
            range r and inflict x damage upon a successful hit; damage and range vary
            by enemy type
        
        - innate: track
            No matter where the player is, the enemy will always know the player's location;
            obstacles (iater mechanic) don't prevent enemies from attacking or locking on to 
            player's location
        
        - interaction: bypass
            Some enemies can get through obstacles by hurdling through them; generally, they're
            able to bypass them in some way that doesn't destroy them

        - status: death
            At 0 health, enemies will end their current actions and perish in their current location
            (dying mechanic)
